# Weekly Challenge 1

For this weeks challenge, we are tasked with refactoring existing code to make it more accessible and to improve SEO. Accessible websites are an important aspect for businesses to consider as we dwelve into a more technological age now that more and more people are using the internet. It is our goal to make sure that everyone can have the same user experience.
I have applied changes to the code following the given acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
